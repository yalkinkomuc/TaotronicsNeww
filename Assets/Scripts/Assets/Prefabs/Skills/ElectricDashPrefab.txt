Unity Electric Dash Prefab Setup Guide:

1. Create a new Empty GameObject named "ElectricDash"

2. Add the following components:
   - ElectricDash.cs script
   - Sprite Renderer
   - 2D Collider (CircleCollider2D or BoxCollider2D)
   - Particle System

3. Configure the Sprite Renderer:
   - Find a suitable electric/lightning sprite or use a simple white circle/square
   - Set color to bright yellow (#FFFF00) or electric blue (#00BFFF)
   - Order in Layer: 5 (to ensure it renders above environment)

4. Configure the Collider:
   - Set as Trigger
   - Set appropriate size (radius ~2.5f for CircleCollider2D)

5. Configure the Particle System:
   - Duration: 0.5s
   - Looping: False
   - Start Lifetime: 0.5s
   - Start Speed: 3
   - Start Size: 0.3
   - Start Color: Bright Yellow (#FFFF00) to Electric Blue (#00BFFF) gradient
   - Shape: Circle (radius 1)
   - Emission Rate: 30-50 particles
   - Add Color Over Lifetime module: 
     - Gradient from full opacity to transparent
   - Add Size Over Lifetime module:
     - Curve that starts at 0, peaks at 0.3, and ends at 0
   - Add Trail module:
     - Width: 0.2
     - Min Vertex Distance: 0.1
     - Color: Yellow/blue gradient
     - Time: 0.2

6. Configure the ElectricDash.cs component:
   - Set damage to 25
   - Set lifeTime to 0.5
   - Set dashDistance to 5
   - Assign the Enemy layer mask
   - Assign the Particle System reference
   - Set effectRadius to 2.5

7. Save the prefab to Assets/Prefabs/Skills/

This prefab will create an electric dash effect with damage area and particle effects that matches the skill's mechanics.

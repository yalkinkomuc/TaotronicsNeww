  - Ah, a traveler! You must be looking for sturdy weapons or fine armor.
  - "I forge my steel with fire and sweat\u2014nothing leaves my anvil unless it's
    perfect."
  - See this sword? It once saved a warrior from a dragon's jaws.
  - If you bring me rare ore, I might craft you something truly special.
  - Now, what do you need? A blade to cut, or a shield to endure?
